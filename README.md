# Rust source statistics 

A basic shell command line called rstat, short for "Rust source statistics". It accpets a directory as an argument

It will generate a file count of Rust sources files, and source code metrics such as the number of blanks, comments, and actual lines of code within 
the directory structure

## Method of use: 
For analise the current folder: `$> rstat -src .` 

For print help: `$> rstat --help`

For future implementations I will add a binary analisis.
